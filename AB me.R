title: About me

#Who am I? ---------------------------------------------------------------

  
#The question we have all thought of. Below is a breif summary of what I have gathered from the past 22 years. 

#My name is Sophia Drewry and I am from Kennesaw GA, a town 45 minutes outside Atlanta. Here at UGA I am a second year MPH student with a concentration in Epidemiology. My interests lie in Infectious disease epidemiology, specifically arboviruses and the
#ecological dynamics of such mosquito-borne diseases. In the past I have done research with dengue seroprevalence & climate affects on aedes aegypti disease transmission. I also worked on a project with [Nick] (https://nicholasmallis.github.io/NicholasMallis-MADA-portfolio/aboutme.html) on Covid-19 and Vaping. This summer I started to work on a evaluation of Puerto Ricoâ€™s passive vs. sentinel dengue surveillance programs. Like most of us in the public health world, I have been pulled into all sorts of projects with Covid-19.
